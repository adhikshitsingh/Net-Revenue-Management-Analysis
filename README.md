# Net Revenue Management Analysis

This project explores the dynamic world of FMCG through a hands-on case study focused on Healthmax, a fictional shampoo brand. The goal is to analyze market data and apply Net Revenue Management (NRM) principles to uncover strategic growth opportunities.

## What I Did:
- Conducted in-depth market analysis using Excel, calculating key KPIs like market share, year-over-year growth, and moving annual total (MAT).
- Built dynamic dashboards with PivotTables, charts, and VLOOKUP to visualize trends and identify actionable insights.
- Applied NRM frameworks including Brand Portfolio Pricing, Mix Management, and Promotion ROI to support data-backed strategic decisions.
- Proposed new product and pricing strategies using Price Pack Architecture, including a travel-size SKU recommendation.
- Created a simple forecasting model to show projected growth with and without NRM interventions.

## Tools Used:
- Microsoft Excel (PivotTables, VLOOKUP, Charts, Forecasting Tools)
- Data Analysis & Visualization
- KPI Calculation and Dashboarding
